## About Me
I'm a Computer Science graduate student at the University of Nevada, Reno, with a multidisciplinary background in AI/LLMs, data analytics, enterprise support, and MIS systems. I build intelligent, user-focused tools that blend deep technical functionality with practical business value. I'm also deeply interested in research involving AI, Large Language Models (LLMs), and Natural Language Processing (NLP).

## ðŸš€ What I Do:

- **Design and deploy LLM-powered applications for support automation, document retrieval, and intelligent user interaction**
- **Build cloud-based workflows, RESTful APIs, databases, and large-scale software systems that support operational and analytical needs**
- **Develop data integration and analytics platforms that deliver real-time insights and process transparency**
- **Create support engineering tools for diagnostics, ticketing, and system troubleshooting**
- **Lead MIS-aligned process tracking, visualization, and optimization initiatives**
