## About Me
I'm a Computer Science graduate student at the University of Nevada, Reno, with interest in AI/LLMs, data science/analytics, enterprise support, and MIS systems. I build intelligent, user-focused tools that blend deep technical functionality with practical business value. I'm also deeply interested in research involving AI, Large Language Models (LLMs), and Natural Language Processing (NLP).

## What I do
As an IT professional with a strong background in systems support, data analysis, and AI, I’ve worked across research, government, and enterprise environments—building smart tools, supporting users, and helping teams solve real problems with technology. I enjoy turning data into insights and using AI to automate tasks, improve decisions, and streamline workflows. Whether it’s fixing systems, creating reports, or building better processes, I focus on making technology clear, useful, and people-friendly.
